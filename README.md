The Beat Box workshop is inspired by both Music Boxes Coder Projects and #Javascript30 Javascript drum kit.  While learning the basics of HTML5, CSS and Javascript attendees will turn their browser into an interactive musical experience. 

##### Description of skills required:

 None. The workshop was designed assuming attendees have no prior knowledge of computing concepts before attending.

##### Skills learned: 

Basic html, basic css, intro to jQuery, basic javascript, buttons, variables, and basic audio. We will be using JavaScript to learn how to create a drumkit. You'll use JavaScript to interact with HTML elements so that your page can react to click and keyboard events by playing different audio files.
